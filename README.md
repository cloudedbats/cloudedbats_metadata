# CloudedBats - Metadata

This is a part of CloudedBats: http://cloudedbats.org

## metadata4bats

The software library metadata4bats will contain functionality both for manually entered metadata and metadata automatically extracted from sound files. 
Metadata will mainly be used to describe the collection of data exported for various purposes. 
When creating DarwinCore Archives some parts are needed for the EML.XML file and other parts are for the occurrence and event tables. 

The GUANO metadata format will be used for reading and writing metadata from/to sound files. 

For some specific detectors like Pettersson D500x and AudioMoth specific metadata import methods will be developed.
